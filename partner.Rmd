## Lab 1 Part II Step 2

1. Your (the Partner’s) full name and GitHub username.
    - Partner's name: Dongming Li.
    - GitHub username: dongming-li.
    
2. What did the Owner do in the most recent commit? What is the commit ID?
    - The Owner changed job.png to job.jpg 
    - The commit ID is 02e692671b8263b2396685880e44a64a8dd28a12

3. Knit the Owner’s hw1.Rmd. Are you able to do so without error? If you cannot, what errors did you counter?
    - I cannot knit the owner's hw1.Rmd.
    - Reason: File job.png not found in resource path
    - Error: pandoc document conversion failed with error 99
    - After partner uploaded his picture on GitHub, the error has been fixed.

4. Also include an error/difficulty you encountered, or a tip for making Git/GitHub easier.
    - Tip: To copy and paste commands in bash, use "shift + ctrl + c" and "shift + ctrl + v".
